# A2: U.S. COVID Trends

## Overview
In many ways, we have come to understand the gravity and trends in the COVID-19 pandemic through data. Regardless of media source, people are consuming more epidemiological information than ever, primarily through reported figures, charts, and maps.

This assignment is your opportunity to work directly with the same data used by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/). While the analysis is guided through a series of questions, it is your opportunity to use programming skills to ask more detailed questions about the pandemic.

## Getting Started
You should start this assignment by opening up the `analysis.R` script. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data.

* **Coding prompts.** Complete the coding prompts in `analysis.R`. You MUST use the `dplyr` package.

* **Reflection prompts.** Throughout `analysis.R`, there are prompts labeled `"Reflection"`. Please write at least 1-3 sentences for each of these prompts below in this `README.md` file. As appropriate, provide evidence, give justification for your opinions, or genuinely reflect on your views. Please strive for concise, clear, and interesting writing.

## Reflection 1
Before actually calculating the total number of COVID cases and deaths, record your guesses for the following questions.

Guess: How many total COVID cases do you think there have been in the U.S.?
over 1,000 cases is my guess. That is my guess because I heard about so many over the news. If there were only few amounts then we would not have gone in quarantine. 

Guess: How many total COVID-related deaths do you think there have been in the U.S.?
over 200 deaths is my guess. A lot of people got COVID but I do not think a lot of people died of it. I do not remember hear so many die from it.

Guess: Which state do you think has the highest number of COVID cases, and which state do you think has the lowest?
California or Florida are my guesses. They seem the biggest and the places where people are close together. If they are close then it would be easier to spread COVID.

## Reflection 2
Did the number of COVID cases and deaths surprise you? Why or why not? What about the states with the highest and lowest number of cases? How did your guesses line up with the actual results? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

There were way more deaths than I thought there were. I was only thinking about in the United States. They lined up about the same. 

## Reflection 3
Which county has the highest number of cases in the state of Washington, and does it surprise you? Why or why not? (You may need to google this county to learn about it) Answer at least in 1-3 sentences

Franklin county had the highest cases. It does surprise me because I have never heard of it. I would think it is one of the more heard counties.  

## Reflection 4
Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable `lowest_deaths_in_each_state`? That is, wouldn't you expect the number to be around 50? Why is the number greater than 50? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
 There are so many counties in each state. States are bigger then we think. 

## Reflection 5
What do you think about the number and scale of the inconsistencies in the data? Does the fact that there are inconsistencies mean that people should not use this data? Why or why not? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
The numbers may change because sometimes code is inconsistent. They should because it is still close to accurate. 

## Reflection 6
Why were you interested in this particular question? Were you able to answer your question with code? What did you learn? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences 
I was interested in total cases because there were so many more cases than I thought. 

## Reflection 7
What, if anything, made you curious about this COVID analysis? What, if anything, surprised you? What might you do the same or differently on your next data wrangling project? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
The death count really surprised me. I would use the same type of data collection.
